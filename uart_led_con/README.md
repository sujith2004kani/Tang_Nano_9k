# ðŸ”Œ UART-Controlled LED Selector â€“ Tang Nano 9K

This FPGA project demonstrates how to control on-board LEDs via **UART** using the **Tang Nano 9K**. It receives 8-bit serial data and lights up **only one LED** based on the lower 6 bits of the value received.

---

## Overview

-  **UART RX** operating at **115200 baud**
-  Single **active-low LED** ON based on received index (`0â€“5`)
-  Out-of-range values turn **all LEDs OFF**
-  Implemented in **Verilog 2001**, tested on **Tang Nano 9K**
-  Fully synthesizable and works with open or official Gowin toolchain
